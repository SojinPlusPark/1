## About

**ZeroWasteGourmet** is a web application that helps people waste less food at home. It guides users to cook with recipes that minimise food waste, plan their grocery shopping, and create weekly meal plans. By using this app, users can change their shopping, cooking, and eating habits in a sustainable way. 
 
You can search for recipes based on ingredients you have at home. The recipes include tips on how to use all parts of an ingredient. For example, you can use an onion skin, a broccoli stem, or the end of a mushroom.
