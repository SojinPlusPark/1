# ZeroWasteGourmet

A web application that helps people waste less ingredients and food while cooking and eating.

## Introduction

ZeroWasteGourmet is a web application that helps people waste less food. 

Every year, Europe produces a staggering 47 million tonnes of food waste originating from households. This has severe environmental and economic consequences. ZeroWasteGourmet aims to tackle this issue by addressing the root causes and providing a comprehensive solution.

Our website empowers users in three ways:
1. Search for recipes using leftover ingredients to minimize food waste
2. Efficiently plan grocery shopping
3. Create meal plans with our easy-to-use weekly planner

By changing buying, cooking, and eating habits, we can make sustainable choices and significantly reduce food waste from home.


DETAILED INFORMATION
It provides the user with recipes for leftover food and ingredients by creatively using up all parts of the food. The user can search for recipes by ingredients and therefore cook with what they still have at home. It gives helpful tips on how to use "leftover" parts of food and how to grocery shop more consciously. It also provides the user with a weekly planner for their meals and a shopping list accordingly.

In a world grappling with food waste, a group of dedicated individuals came together to tackle the issue head-on. Their brainchild, "ZeroWasteGourmet," is a web application aimed at renewing the way we approach cooking, grocery shopping, and sustainability.

The team, comprising Data Scientists Irene Gon and Daniel J. Paul, Web Developers Guilherme F. M. Muniz and So Jin Park, and User Experience Designers Thamiris Câmara and Jana Müller, alongside mentors Kate Borovikova and Petra Broeken, embarked on a mission to combat the staggering 47 million tonnes of food waste generated by European households annually.

"ZeroWasteGourmet" stands as an innovative solution to minimize food waste at home. It encourages users to cook with recipes that make the most of ingredients, even those typically discarded, like onion peels or broccoli stems. The app also helps users plan their grocery shopping and meals, creating a sustainable cooking experience.

The project's development involved planning and execution across multiple tracks. The UX team crafted user-friendly wireframes, while the front-end developer brought these designs to life, ensuring a seamless user interface. On the back end, a Node.js server was set up and connected to Python, integrating data and exploring the potential for a recommendation system. The data science team played a pivotal role in the project. They developed a recipe scraper to extract data from existing webpages and recommended recipes to utilize up to three core ingredients. A Flask API was built to facilitate communication between Python and Node.js.

With plans to further enhance the recommendation system, expand the recipe database, and engage with user feedback for continuous improvement, "ZeroWasteGourmet" is poised to make a substantial impact on reducing food waste.

**Tech Stack**

Backend: ????????? PLS FILL
- Python
- Node.js
- Flask API

Frontend:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React 
- Bulma

**Building the user interface and connecting them to the database ?????**

??????? how you build and connected the app and the database


For displaying the web app, we use **React**, a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces, as well as **Bulma**, a CSS framework. For page routing, **React Router** is applied.



## Team: Data Science

[Irene Gon, Daniel Paul]

**Tech Stack**
Python, SQLite3

**Data Collection & Search feature**

#### Summary
We built a recipe scraper to scrape recipes from food.com. We created databases in SQLite3 with categorised data: vegan, vegetarian, meat, fish, waste recipes, etc. We also built a search feature in Python using 3 keywords the user would enter (3 different ingredients) as well as intermediary files to connect the search to the databases.
We also built the initial API in Flask to connect to the Backend.
Users can use our our files in the git repository


## If we had more time
We would have created a feature for recommending recipes based on user´s preferences and saved recipes and similar searched items.

**[UX]**
- User Profiles & Customization: Allowing users to personalize their experience and save favorite recipes
- User Feedback & Continuous Improvement: Listening to our users and incorporating their valuable insights to make the platform even better
- Sustainability Promotion & Partnerships
Engaging in outreach activities to raise awareness and forging partnerships to amplify our impact

**[WD]**
- Mobile App Development: Expanding our reach by exploring the development of a mobile application

**[DS]**
- Expanded Recipe Database: Continuously adding new and diverse recipes to inspire sustainable cooking
- Refined Recommendation System: Enhancing the accuracy of recipe suggestions based on user preferences
